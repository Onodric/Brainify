## Getting Started

Download or clone the project to your machine.

```
npm install
bower install
```

Run `grunt` in the `lib` folder to build Brainify locally.

## Machine learning techniques

Brainify relies on [Synaptic.js](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/#/) to create neural networks that learn a user's music preferences.
